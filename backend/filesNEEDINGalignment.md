I apologize for misinterpreting your architecture. Let me focus on the hybridization approach and correctly identify what needs to be aligned.

# Understanding Your Hybrid Architecture

Your platform is using a sophisticated hybrid approach that combines:

1. **Database-Driven Operations**: Direct interaction with PostgreSQL for data storage and retrieval 
2. **Tool-Based Operations**: Microservices architecture for specialized functions
3. **AI Orchestration**: Using Instructor for structured tool selection and execution

The key innovation is how these components work together:

- The AI determines when to use database operations vs. tool calls
- Memory is stored in vector database for contextual retrievals
- Tools provide specialized functionality as independent microservices
- The system maintains state across interactions through the database

## Files Needing Alignment

Based on this understanding, here are the files that need proper naming convention alignment:

1. **`backend/app/ai/service.py`**:
   - Currently defines its own Pydantic models with `tool_name` properties
   - Contains the hybrid decision logic for tool selection

2. **`backend/app/ai/tool_models.py`**:
   - Defines comprehensive Pydantic models with `action` properties
   - These should be imported and used by service.py

3. **`backend/app/tools/tools_config.json`**:
   - Uses a different structure with array of tools, each with a `name` and `actions` array
   - Each action has `name`, `description`, `required_params`, `optional_params`

4. **`backend/app/tools/registry.py`**:
   - Expects fields like `description`, `server_url`, `input_schema`, `output_schema`
   - These don't align with your JSON structure

5. **`backend/app/tools/client.py`**:
   - Executes tool calls using `tool_name` and `arguments` parameters

## Required Changes for Alignment

1. **Standardize on a single naming convention**:
   - Either change `tool_models.py` to use `tool_name` instead of `action`
   - Or change `service.py` to use `action` instead of `tool_name`
   - The name should match the structure in `tools_config.json`

2. **Modify `registry.py` validation**:
   - Update to validate against the actual structure in `tools_config.json`
   - It should expect `name`, `display_name`, `description`, `server_url`, `actions`

3. **Update tool execution pathway**:
   - Ensure `client.py` can map from either `action` or `tool_name` to the correct tool server
   - Update the `execute_tool` function to use the right parameter names

4. **Choose one model source**:
   - Ideally, import models from `tool_models.py` in `service.py`
   - Remove duplicate definitions
   - Or if you prefer, move everything to `service.py` and remove `tool_models.py`

## Recommended Approach

1. **Keep `tool_models.py` but update it**:
   ```python
   # Choose ONE naming convention for consistency:
   class GetChoreStatusCall(BaseModel):
       tool_name: Literal["get_chore_status"] = "get_chore_status"  # Match service.py
       arguments: GetChoreStatusArgs  # Match name in service.py
   ```

2. **Update `registry.py` to match your JSON structure**:
   ```python
   def validate_tool_config(tool_config: Any) -> bool:
       # Check for fields that match your JSON
       required_fields = ["name", "display_name", "description", "server_url", "actions"]
       # ...
   ```

3. **Modify `client.py` to work with your tool structure**:
   ```python
   async def execute_tool(tool_name: str, action: str, arguments: Dict[str, Any]):
       # tool_name = "chore_tool"
       # action = "get_chore_status"
       # Get server URL from tool_name, then add action to path
       # ...
   ```

The most important thing is ensuring that the naming flows consistently through your entire system, from the JSON configuration to the tool models to the tool execution.
