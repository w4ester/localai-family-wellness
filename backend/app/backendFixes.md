# Backend Fixes Implementation

This document summarizes the fixes implemented to address the naming and structural issues in the backend codebase.

## 1. Database Connection Management

**Issue:** Duplicate functionality in `init_db.py` and `session.py`.

**Fix:** 
- Replaced `init_db.py` with a deprecation notice and forwarded imports to `session.py`.
- Left `session.py` as the single source of truth for database connection management.

**Rationale:** The functionality was correctly refactored out of the old init_db.py into session.py and the application lifespan manager in main.py.

## 2. SQLAlchemy Base Class

**Issue:** Incomplete Base class implementation in `base.py`.

**Fix:**
- Completed the Base class implementation with:
  - UUID primary key with default value
  - created_at and updated_at timestamps with server defaults
  - Automatic tablename generation based on class name
  - Properly decorated with @as_declarative
  - Added naming conventions for database constraints

**Rationale:** A complete Base class is fundamental for all models to work correctly, providing common fields and behavior.

## 3. Model Imports in Table Creation

**Issue:** Missing model imports in the `ensure_tables_created()` function.

**Fix:**
- Added imports for all models to ensure they are registered with SQLAlchemy's metadata:
  ```python
  from app.db.models.user_model import User
  from app.db.models.family_model import Family
  from app.db.models.screen_time_model import ScreenTimeRule, ScreenTimeUsage, ScreenTimeExtensionRequest
  from app.db.models.chore_model import Chore, ChoreCompletion
  from app.db.models.ai_memory import AIMemory
  ```

**Rationale:** All models must be imported for SQLAlchemy to know about them when creating tables.

## 4. Missing CRUD Implementation

**Issue:** Missing `get_extension_requests_multi()` function referenced in `screen_time.py` but not implemented.

**Fix:**
- Implemented the function in `screen_time_crud.py` with:
  - Proper permission handling (parents/admins see family requests, children see only their own)
  - Filtering by user and status
  - SQL queries with joins to respect family boundaries
  - Error handling and logging

**Rationale:** This function is needed for the extension request listing endpoint to work correctly.

## 5. API Endpoint Update

**Issue:** The endpoint for listing extension requests was disabled.

**Fix:**
- Updated the endpoint to use the newly implemented CRUD function.

**Rationale:** With the CRUD function now implemented, the endpoint can be enabled.

## Other Recommendations (Not Implemented)

1. **API Endpoint Naming:** Consider standardizing API endpoint naming (ai.py → ais.py, auth.py → auths.py)

2. **Set Up Alembic:** For production use, set up Alembic for database migrations instead of using SQLAlchemy's create_all

## Next Steps

1. Test the implemented changes to ensure they work as expected
2. Consider addressing the recommendations for further improvements
3. Review any other TODOs in the codebase for completion
